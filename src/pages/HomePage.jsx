              Hello! 
              Welcome to my Honkai Fan Page! 
              I have been developing this on my own both as a love project for a game that has brought me so much joy, but also as a project to keep my web development brain active
              In this website I will have: 
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A materials calculator for players who would like an estimation of the amount of runs they would need to accrue a certain amount of materials</li>
                <li>A list of characters by path that will show damage type so that players can build teams based off path and damage type</li>
                <li>A section for newer characters that will let users see what materials they should be pre-grinding for the next patch</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
      );
